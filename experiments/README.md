# Experiments

An electron app that provides a framework for diggit related prototyping,
visualisations and experiements.

### Code Overview

Can we pull data from a repo that enables us to identify how the architectural

This represents an experiment in data parsing and presentation. Aims are to gain
familiarity with the git API and gain some experience with data visualisation
toolkits, along with extract genuine insights from the code.
