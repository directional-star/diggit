- Motivation on why we want data; 60% of project cost is in maintainance
- "...we want to optimize any aspect of software development, maintenance is the most important part
  to focus on"
- Intuition doesn't scale
- Problem similar to that of geographically profiling criminal activities in an effort to predict
  next occurances

## [2] Detecting Refactoring Deligence - https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/detecting-refactoring-diligence

- Create profile of a repo that states how many methods have been increased in size last n times
  they have been changed
- Highlights whether the codebase as a whole is increasing, and whether there is sufficient
  care paid to resist code growth by refactor
- Profile looks like [135, 89, 14, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] - one method has been increased in size the
  last 9 times it was modified
